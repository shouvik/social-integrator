# RC Branch Workflow Documentation

## Overview

The RC (Release Candidate) branch workflow automatically creates and maintains a dedicated branch containing pre-built binaries whenever changes are merged to the `main` branch. This enables users to install the SDK directly from GitHub without needing to build it locally.

## Purpose

The RC branch serves as a distribution channel for:

- **Development installations**: Install the latest main branch with pre-built binaries
- **Testing**: Test the SDK without local build steps
- **CI/CD**: Use in CI pipelines without build overhead
- **Quick prototyping**: Rapidly integrate the SDK in test projects

## Installation

### From RC Branch

```bash
npm install github:shouvik/oauth-connector-sdk#rc
```

This will install the latest version from the main branch with pre-compiled binaries.

### From Main Branch (requires build)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shouvik/oauth-connector-sdk.git
cd oauth-connector-sdk
npm install
npm run build
```

## How It Works

### Workflow Trigger

The workflow triggers automatically on:

- ‚úÖ Merged pull requests to `main`
- ‚úÖ Direct commits to `main` (with commit message check)

The workflow does NOT trigger on:

- ‚ùå Pull request creation or updates
- ‚ùå Commits to other branches
- ‚ùå Tag pushes

### Workflow Steps

1. **Checkout & Setup**
   - Checks out main branch with full history
   - Sets up Node.js 20 with npm caching
   - Installs all dependencies

2. **Quality Checks**
   - Runs full test suite (`npm test`)
   - Fails the workflow if tests don't pass
   - Ensures code quality before building

3. **Build Process**
   - Compiles TypeScript to `dist/` folder
   - Generates JSON schema to `src/core/normalizer/schema.json`
   - Verifies all build artifacts exist

4. **Artifact Verification**
   - Checks `dist/index.js` exists
   - Checks `dist/index.d.ts` exists
   - Checks `src/core/normalizer/schema.json` exists
   - Lists dist contents and size

5. **RC Branch Management**
   - Fetches or creates `rc` branch
   - Resets RC branch to latest main
   - Stages built artifacts and necessary files
   - Creates commit with metadata
   - Force pushes to RC branch

6. **Notifications**
   - Posts commit comment with installation instructions
   - Generates workflow summary with links
   - Notifies on failure with troubleshooting steps

### Files Included in RC Branch

The RC branch includes only these files:

- `dist/` - Complete TypeScript build output
- `src/core/normalizer/schema.json` - Generated JSON schema
- `package.json` - Package metadata and dependencies
- `README.md` - Documentation
- `LICENSE` - License file (if exists)
- `.releaserc.json` - Release configuration (if exists)

### Files Excluded from RC Branch

These files are NOT included (to keep the branch clean):

- `src/` - Source TypeScript files (not needed, use dist/)
- `tests/` - Test files
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies (npm installs these)
- `.github/` - Workflow files
- `docs/` - Additional documentation
- Dev configuration files (`.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`, etc.)

## Build Metadata

Each RC branch commit includes metadata:

```
chore(rc): update RC branch with built artifacts from main@<SHA>

Build date: 2025-10-25 12:34:56 UTC
Main branch SHA: abc1234567890
Triggered by: Merge pull request #123 from user/feature

This commit contains pre-built binaries for easy installation:
npm install github:shouvik/oauth-connector-sdk#rc
```

## Workflow Outputs

### Success Output

When successful, the workflow:

1. ‚úÖ Updates RC branch with latest build
2. üìù Posts commit comment with installation instructions
3. üìä Generates workflow summary with links
4. üîó Provides direct links to RC branch and diff

### Failure Output

When failed, the workflow:

1. ‚ùå Does not update RC branch
2. üìù Posts failure comment with troubleshooting steps
3. üîç Links to workflow logs for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

**Issue**: Build fails with TypeScript errors

```
Error: dist directory not found
```

**Solution**:

1. Run `npm run typecheck` locally to identify issues
2. Fix TypeScript errors in source files
3. Commit fixes and merge to main

### Test Failures

**Issue**: Tests fail during workflow

```
Error: test suite failed
```

**Solution**:

1. Run `npm test` locally to reproduce
2. Fix failing tests
3. Ensure all tests pass before merging

### Permission Issues

**Issue**: Workflow fails with permission errors

```
Error: Permission denied (publickey)
```

**Solution**:

1. Check repository settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Workflow permissions
2. Ensure "Read and write permissions" is enabled
3. Verify `GITHUB_TOKEN` has `contents: write` permission

### Git Conflicts

**Issue**: RC branch has conflicts with main

```
Error: failed to push some refs
```

**Solution**:

1. The workflow uses `git reset --hard` and force push
2. This should automatically resolve conflicts
3. If persists, manually delete RC branch and re-run workflow:
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete rc
   ```

### Schema Generation Failures

**Issue**: JSON schema not generated

```
Error: schema.json not found
```

**Solution**:

1. Verify `scripts/generate-schema.ts` exists
2. Check schema generation script for errors
3. Run `npm run generate:schema` locally to debug

## Maintenance

### Updating the Workflow

To modify the RC branch workflow:

1. Edit `.github/workflows/create-rc-branch.yml`
2. Test changes on a feature branch first
3. Merge to main after verification

### Cleaning Up Old RC Branches

The RC branch is force-pushed on every update, so:

- ‚úÖ History is automatically cleaned
- ‚úÖ No manual cleanup needed
- ‚úÖ Old commits are garbage collected

### Monitoring Workflow Health

Check workflow status:

1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Create RC Branch" workflow
3. View recent runs and success rate
4. Check logs for any warnings

## Integration with CI/CD

### Using RC Branch in Downstream Projects

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "oauth-connector-sdk": "github:shouvik/oauth-connector-sdk#rc"
  }
}
```

### Locking to Specific Commit

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "oauth-connector-sdk": "github:shouvik/oauth-connector-sdk#abc1234"
  }
}
```

Where `abc1234` is the RC branch commit SHA.

## Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. ‚úÖ Always run tests locally before merging to main
2. ‚úÖ Ensure build succeeds locally (`npm run build`)
3. ‚úÖ Review RC branch after merge to verify artifacts
4. ‚ùå Don't commit directly to RC branch (auto-generated)

### For Maintainers

1. ‚úÖ Monitor workflow success rate (should be >99%)
2. ‚úÖ Review RC branch periodically for correctness
3. ‚úÖ Update workflow as dependencies change
4. ‚úÖ Document any RC branch usage in README

### For Users

1. ‚úÖ Use RC branch for development and testing
2. ‚úÖ Pin to specific commits for production
3. ‚úÖ Report issues if RC branch installation fails
4. ‚ùå Don't expect stable versioning from RC branch

## FAQ

### Q: How often is RC branch updated?

**A**: On every merge to main branch.

### Q: Can I install from RC branch in production?

**A**: Not recommended. RC branch is for development/testing. Use npm releases for production.

### Q: What if I need an older RC version?

**A**: RC branch is force-pushed, so history is lost. Use git tags or npm releases for versioning.

### Q: Why not just publish to npm on every commit?

**A**: RC branch provides faster iteration without polluting npm registry. Semantic releases control npm publishing.

### Q: Can I manually trigger the RC workflow?

**A**: Currently no. It triggers automatically on main merges. You can add `workflow_dispatch` if needed.

### Q: What's the difference between RC and release?

**A**: RC branch is continuous deployment from main (unversioned). Releases are semantic versions published to npm (versioned).

### Q: How do I test the workflow locally?

**A**: Use `act` (GitHub Actions local runner) or push to a test repository.
